=======================

Judging whether a batsman has been "run out" is one of the trickier tasks facing the umpires officiating in a game of cricket. Now, an inexpensive computer vision system can be developed that it is claimed can do the job as well as a human official, and without the need for a time-consuming video replay.  Run out decisions which were a major headache earlier were solved by referring to third umpire who uses a video replay to make that decision. This typically takes quite a few minutes for the communication to go back and forth. It really disrupts the flow. So, it may be automated?  So, this project is introduced by us to quicken the run out decisions. This system has a low-cost video sitting on the field and some software that scans the video feeds for moving objects. The system automatically identifies the position of the crease and the wicket, and tracks the motion of the bat. If it detects any movement of the wicket while the bat is outside the crease, it deems the batsman to be run out. Also, it makes use of object recognition &amp; object extraction feature of image processing.
